I am Jelena. My small cattery is located in Riga, Latvia. 
The cattery and cats are registered with FIFe association and CFCA club “SELENA”. 

All my cats live freely in my home and are surrounded with love and attention. 
I am for quality, not quantity. 

Kindly note, that I have a closed cattery and so do NOT offer stud services. 

Thank you for visiting my web site, and if you like my cats, please visit me again. 
I am looking forward to answer you any questions that you might have about my cattery, cats and kittens.
